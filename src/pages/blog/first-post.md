This website was started on 4th of December 2022 and the building process will be totally open and public. It is using [Astro](https://astro.build)'s default personal website started as starting point and I'm going to customise it to match my technical and content needs.

Source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/azurinspire/kallepyorala-com) and it is automatically published by [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).
